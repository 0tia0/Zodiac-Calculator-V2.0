## 🖥️ Development

### 📥 Installation

You need to install the graphics.h library and its relative libs. All files can be found [here](https://github.com/SagarGaniga/Graphics-Library/) and should be placed in the respective folders: **.h** files in the compiler's **include** folder and **.a** files in the compiler's **lib** folder.

I personally recommend to use [MinGW64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) as the compiler for this project, and place his **bin** folder inside the windows **System Enviroment Variables** 

### ⚙️ Deployment

After you have installed and configured the compiler you can run this command in the root folder of this project:
```sh
g++ main.cpp -o main.exe -lbgi -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32 -luuid -loleaut32 -lole32 -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
```
I reccomend to use the VSCode extension **code runner** to do all this stuff by just pressing a button. My personal configuration is:
```json
{
    "code-runner.runInTerminal": true, //true terminal //false output
    "code-runner.executorMap": {
            "c": "cd $dir && gcc $fileName -o $fileNameWithoutExt && .\\$fileNameWithoutExt",
            "cpp": "cd $dir && g++ $fileName -o $fileNameWithoutExt -lbgi -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32 -luuid -loleaut32 -lole32 -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system && .\\$fileNameWithoutExt ",
    },
}
```
All this should be placed inside the **settings.json** file from VSCode
